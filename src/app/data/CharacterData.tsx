      "Despising the cursed blood that ran through his veins, Jin Kazama sought to bring an end to the devil bloodline. He joined forces with Lars Alexandersson, and together they prepared to commence Operation Lightning, a plan to eliminate the other bearer of the devil gene, Kazuya Mishima. Jin had once plunged the world into chaos in order to resurrect Azazel, the devil gene's progenitor. His plan was to permanently extinguish the devil gene by defeating Azazel once and for all, even if it cost him his own life. While Jin managed to defeat Azazel, he lost consciousness and fell into a deep sleep. During his absence, G Corporation, led by Kazuya, took over the world by force. Several months later, Jin finally regained consciousness. His deadly struggle with Azazel had taught him how to control his inner devil power. Jin swore to end Kazuya's reign of terror in order to atone for the war and destruction he had caused.",

In Tekken 8, he's been given a new buff called Snake Eyes (SNE) which gives him access to several new moves, as well as some upgraded versions of previous moves. Learning how and when to activate and utilize Snake Eyes is crucial.",

    weaknesses: [
      "Lacking in standing block punishment.",
      "Poor panic tools and evasion.",
      "One of the highest execution characters.",
    ],
    gameplan: [
      "His backsway gives him access to Hatchet Kick (SWA.3), one of the most chunky and oppressive lows in the game, and his new Cannonball Straight (SWA.1), a +5 on block high with blistering speed and great range. His crouchdash, a.k.a Slither Step (SLS), gives him extremely good wall carry capabilities, with multiple mixups to catch opponents trying to jab out. Bryan has strong pressure at the wall, with many oppressive options, such as TNTb+4 or TJU, being unblockable moves that guarantee wall combos, 3+4, hold 2, which wallsplats regardless of being blocked or not, and his heat smash, which is +17 on block at the wall. \n",
      "As far as flashiness goes, this all pales in comparison to his taunt (1+3+4), an unblockable mid that gives him a massive 16 frames of advantage, not only giving him the chance to hit with a normal attack, but also allowing him to hit the infamous Taunt Jet Upper (1+3+4 f,b+2), an unblockable launcher - with the trade-off of requiring multiple frame perfect inputs. Learning how to utilize Bryan's taunt in oki or standing pressure situations is necessary to use Bryan at a high level.",
      "Bryan's explosive, high damage gameplan comes with the penalty of poor standing punishment and optimizing his punishment requires some very difficult execution. Getting the most out of Bryan requires a great deal of intermediate and high level understanding of almost every notable mechanic in Tekken, but the reward is one of the scariest characters to press a button against in the entire game.",
